Emergency stop is implemented in the form of freezing votes. As the application
is under a lot of access control, the emergency stop is not as pervasive
as it would probably be in a different application.

I also implemented a variable access design pattern to improve performance.
This design pattern makes greater use of structs and mappings; allowing arbitrary
access in constant time rather than having a potentially unwieldy loop.
