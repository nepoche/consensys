I wrote three tests in solidity and two tests in javascript.

Most of the community writes tests in javascript; however, the throw proxy
pattern available via solidity testing seemed to be a lot more elegant in
testing for correct contract throws.

The other tests were written in javascript due to the difficulty of writing
tests in solidity from the perspective of different account.

The tests mostly cover access controls to various aspects of the application.
