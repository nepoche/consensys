When thinking about security, I decided to use battle-tested libraries like SafeMath
to eliminate chances of integer overflow/underflow. I further eliminated this risk
by starting indices at "1" rather than "0".

The variable access design-pattern that I used also eliminates DOS attacks via
transaction spam as random accesses to my data is completed in constant time.
