Welcome to GBC votes, an application designed to monitor the voting aspects
of a university organization. The president is able to create elections,
and pre-approved members are eligible to vote in these elections.

After installing basic dependencies such as node, npm, and truffle start the
application:
    1) run npm install
    2) ganache-cli
    3) truffle compile && truffle migrate
    4) npm run start


To create an election, navigate to "/admin" and follow the prompt. Any accounts
that should be voting need to be approved by whichever account deployed the
contracts.

After creating an election, approved members can vote from the "/dashboard" page.
